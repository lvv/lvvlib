array.h  - compile-time sized arrays based on boost/array.hpp 

	added 3rd template param BEGIN - index starts from BEGIN, defaults to 0
	added ostream friend ( you can do  cout << array; ) 
	added index getter - ibegin/iend() 
	added operator[] bounds checking:
		check is done if compiled with -g (macro NDEBUG is defined)
		I like to split debug compile into to subtipes: CHECK and DEBUG
		So there are two more controling macros CHECK and NOCHECK
		if CHECK is defined bounds check is done.
		if NOCHECK is defined bounds check is not done (NDEBUG ignored)
	WIP removed dependency on boost

	see t-array.h for sample use

	vs. other
		sizeof


mmap.h  simple mmap(3) wrapper
